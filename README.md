# About

This is a weekend project to find small and medium-sized businesses that have a website but whose site no longer meets today’s standards.
It was implemented with Node and Angular.
The backend crawls the websites and looks for email addresses to contact me.

## Setup

to test use skaffold dev.
to reach maildev you have to add to your /etc/hosts:
[NODE IP] maildev.local
