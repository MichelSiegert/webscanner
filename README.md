## About

This is a weekend project to find small and medium-sized businesses that have a website but whose site no longer meets today’s standards.
It was implemented with Node and Angular.
The backend crawls the websites and looks for email addresses to contact me.

## Todo:
There is still quite a bit to be done on the frontend.
Currently, the filter function does not work, and ideally, I would like it as a dropdown with the emails.
Additionally, I should create a service for automatically sending emails.
At the moment, this application only runs locally.
It will be converted into a cloud-native application—meaning it will be dockerized and then deployed to a cluster (internally).
